OpenAPI GUI Editor (JetBrains Plugin)
========================

<!-- Plugin description -->
GUI Editor for OpenAPI specification (OAS) 3.0 and 3.1.

## Why does the plugin exist?

While the OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification was initially designed to be human-editable, it has grown increasingly complex over time. Even with syntax highlighting and robust autocompletion tools, creating and maintaining OpenAPI documents remains challenging. The verbose format is easy to get lost in and requires familiarity with numerous technical details.

OpenAPI GUI Editor solves these problems by providing an **intuitive visual interface** that allows you to create and modify valid OpenAPI documents in seconds - no deep specification knowledge required.
## Restrictions
- The plugin currently supports the latest OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 standards, with support for earlier versions coming soon.
- If your openapi.yml references multiple files, the plugin will only work with the main one.
